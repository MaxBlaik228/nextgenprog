## What is markdown?
Markdown is an easy to use and read language for styling text. It is designed to be easily read by both a computer and a human.

## Where is markdown used?
Markdown is commonly used among programmers to style text that will be read by other humans (for example, code's documentation and README.md files that accompany most projects). Markdown is used to edit Wikis and some webpages. Even our [website](torgyn.github.io/nextgenprog) is (mostly) created using markdown! 

## How do I write in markdown?
Here is a useful tutorial on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

We recommend:
- First check out [Examples](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#examples) of styling Headers, Links, Images, Code, Lists, and even Quotes using markdown.
- Then you can using markdown yourself, by creating a new *.md* file.
- Work throught the [Syntax Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax) and try each section out in your *.md* file.
- Check out how your markdown would be displayed by the computer using Preview. If you spot something you didn't like or want to change, you can go back to Edit mode and back to Preview.

## Next steps
Knowing markdown would become even more useful as you progress with your coding and would start collaborating with other programmers on platforms such as GitHub. There is a version of markdown specifically for that. Learn more [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown).
